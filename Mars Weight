Note that a person on Earth's weight on Mars is
equal to 37.8% of their weight on Earth, therefore,
we need to convert 37.8% to 0.378 in our formula. 
We also use "round(mars_weight, 2)" to indicate that we 
want Python to round our variable to the nearest XYZ
number of decimal points (which in our case, is 2).
